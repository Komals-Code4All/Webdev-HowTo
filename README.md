## Web Developement How To Sample Code 

Example code of how to do stuff in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<img src="assets/images/webDev.PNG">

This repo contains simple, worked examples of HTML, CSS and JS code showing how to do common things in web design and development.

Each sample webpage has a standard header and footer, copied in from files in the folder <em>assets/embedCode</em>. These give a common header and footer to each HowTo code file, and can be amended if you wish.

There is also a common <em>style.css</em> file held in assets. However, where a HTML file requires additional CSS code, it is included in the HTML's <code> &lt;style&gt;<code> tag for ease of reference.
